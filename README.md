### Analysis

- From the box plot it can be observed that the mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane had significantly smaller tumor size after treament on average then the other medications. 
- From the linear regression it can be observed that tumor volume is on average larger on larger mice. This is an important fact to consider especially in regards to the other plots. For example, if it is the case the the experiments conducted with Capomulin and Ramicane were completed using smaller mice than the other experiments, than this fact would counter the conclusions drawn in the previous bullet point. This hypothesis was easy to test, in the final cell under "BONUS" at the end of this notebook the average weight of the mice in each drug regimen was determined. The hypothsis that Capomulin and Ramicane used smaller mice was proven correct! This indicates that the conclusion in the first bullet point above is skewed by the fact that smaller mice were used for those two drug regimens. 
- The line chart of Capomulin on mouse_l509 shows reduction of tumor size over time while under treatment.

#### These data points above do not all agree with eachother, however they do all make true interpretations of the data. This goes to show that the meaning we draw from data is not always clear, and that sometimes, it requires intelligent and thorough investigation to make the apporpriate conclusions.

#### As a senior data analyst working at  Pymaceuticals, Inc. this data draws suspicions about the integrity of the company. The experiments done on Capomulin should not have been done on smaller mice compared to the other drugs. Aside from this, the analysis requested of me may not have been the ideal analysis to uncover the true results. Instead of looking at the tumor size at the end of treatment of all the mice, we should only have looked at mice that completed the full 45 days of treatment instead of including some mice that had undergone 0 days of treatment in the Boxplot data. For all the problems with it I'd say the boxplot as is, is practically useless at determining the effectivness of one of the drugs compared to the other. A better way to analyze the data my have been to look at the % change of the tumor size in each mouse over 45 days. This would have addressed the varying size of the mice aswell as the various treatment durations. However, I produced the results that were requested of me.
